## Instructions

- Download mario.  You can pick whatever image you want, but I used this one: https://u.cubeupload.com/THENEWGAMECREATOR/stillgoing.gif
- Install the VSCode extension: Custom CSS and JS Loader
- Take the stylesheet located in this repository and save it somewhere to your computer. Make sure you update the URL to point to your Mario image. 
- Follow the Custom CSS and JS Loader extension instruction on how to point to this stylesheet. 
- Now restart VSCode.
